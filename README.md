The provided Python code is a console-based application simulating a virtual try-on experience. It allows users to select and "try on" different types of items across four categories:

Clothing: Users can choose from T-Shirts, Jeans, Jackets, Dresses, and Shorts.
Accessories: Options include Hats, Sunglasses, Watches, Necklaces, and Bracelets.
Footwear: Users can select Sneakers, Boots, Sandals, Heels, and Loafers.
Outerwear: Choices include Coats, Blazers, Hoodies, Raincoats, and Windbreakers.
After selecting an item, the application simulates the process of virtually fitting and displaying the item in augmented reality (AR) through text-based output. The purpose of this program is to mimic the shopping experience using AR technology in a simple and interactive way.
